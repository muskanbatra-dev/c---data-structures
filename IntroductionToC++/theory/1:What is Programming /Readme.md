# INTRO

# HOW COMPUTERS WORKS

### Computer is super dumb.

### Cannot think independently but it can follow if you provide proper instructions.

### Giving proper instructtions to the compouter so that it can do the work for us.

# HOW DO WE PROVIDE THESE INSTRUCTIONS

### We can do so using different languages like javascrpit, golang , c++.

### Computers dont undrestand these languages they only undrestand 0's and 1's- BINARY

### We write the code in languages like python , java and c++

### the compiler converts this to Binary so that the computer can understand
